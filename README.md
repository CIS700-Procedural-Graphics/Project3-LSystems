## Objective

Learn L Systems by making trees.

## Process

I started off by writing a doubly linked list to represent my L-System. Once  had that down, I introduced the variable of iteration to see what my tree would look like at different steps.<br />

Next, I added width to my tree, such that it was inversely proportional to the iteration.<br />

I added texture to my branches to make it look more like a tree.<br />

I then played altered how my width changes with each iteration.<br />

Finally I added leaves to every branch in my linked list that was at the last iteration.<br />

After some tweaks in the grammar, I was able to achieve some really random looking trees.<br />
