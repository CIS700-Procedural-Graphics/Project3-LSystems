The objective of this assignment is to create an L System parser and generate interesting looking plants. 

One of my plants

# DISCLAIMER
- Once you go past 5 iterations, your computer may commit Seppuku. However, that is not the shinobi way (it's a samurai tradition) and is in fact frowned upon.

# Interactive Component
- Adjust the axiom and watch the plant dynamically change from the new base-case to the correct number of iterations with the new axiom.
- I could've added more, but I ran out of time. I made up for this by adding some fun extras, and spending a decent amount of time trying to make a non-broccoli plant.

# L-System Plants
- Grows in 3D
- Variation! Just click the iterations slider, and the new (randomly generated based off of my rules) tree will take the old one's place.
- The tree branches/trunks also vary by color, and noise is applied to the length of a branch.
- Branches grow thinner as the gree gets taller, with larger, longer branches near the bottom and shorter, skinnier branches at the top.
- Some minecraft like leaves from an OBJ I found online.

# Cool Things
- These trees are 1:1 models of the same trees Naruto once trained on (I actually tried to make my grammar follow their pattern).
- That is Konohagakure in the background, the Villege Hidden in Leaves, of which someday I will be Hokage of. 
- The music is courtesy of Youtube!
